I worked on "American Gallery" dataset that had several issues such as: 

(i) There were missing values in few rows e.g. 2nd row. (ii) Date formats were inconsistent such as "18xx-19xx", "c. 1925" or "-1870". (iii) Many entries were not formatted correctly for their intended data type, making the dataset difficult to analyze.


I resolved these issues by:

(i) Filling in missing values e.g. 2nd row. (ii) I standarized dates into single numerical value e.g. "19xx" and removed unnecessary characters (like "c." , "-" , "()" ). (iii) I reformatted all fields to a format suitable for analysis.
